# PWEB-16427

This is a class assignment to create personal webpage
   - The web use navbar to navigate through pages
   - The first page is just a landing page that says hello and it uses image for the background
   - The second page is my name and the button is susing sass inheritance
   - The third page is my biodata and hobbies using unordered list and it uses grid to devide the content, also it uses sass inheritance        for the button
   - The fourth page contains a table and uses sass to make the blue background

The content, design, and look&feel is still messy but i hope it fullfills the task requirement.
